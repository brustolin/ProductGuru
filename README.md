## About this project
This app fetches products from an API and displays them to the user.

It uses SwiftUI for the interface and follows the MVVM architecture to manage the data flow.
Dependency Injection and clear separation of responsibilities are strongly implemented to 
ensure the project is well-decoupled, easy to maintain, and straightforward to test.
